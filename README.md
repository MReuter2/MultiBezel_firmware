**MultiBezel: Adding Multi-Touch to a Smartwatch Bezel to control music**

Limited screen space and reliance on touch input pose significant challenges for intuitive interaction on smartwatches, often leading to screen occlusion and hindered usability. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents MultiBezel, a novel multi-touch enabled bezel designed to enhance music control on smartwatches. MultiBezel utilises a gesture-based interaction scheme, mapping distinct finger combinations to core music player functions like play/pause, volume adjustment, and track navigation. This approach shifts interaction away from the touchscreen, minimising occlusion and enabling more eyes-free control. While a formal user study is planned for future work, we successfully developed a functional prototype that accurately recognises up to three simultaneous touch points. This prototype demonstrates the feasibility of multi-touch bezel interaction for enhancing the smartwatch user experience, paving the way for comprehensive usability evaluations and exploration of broader applications in future research.
